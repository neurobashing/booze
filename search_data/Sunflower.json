(Pour in a tsp or so, and swirl around till it coats the inside of the glass. Chuck/drink the excess.)Shake equal parts of the rest, and strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with lemon peel.I haven't started giving stars on the site yet, but this one is a standout. Along with the various Daisy family, this is a standout summer drink. Don't like gin? You won't mind it. Think St. Germian - \"the bartender's ketchup\" - is too cloying and sweet, esp. when combined with Triple Sec? Not a problem. A masterclass in perfect balance."}
