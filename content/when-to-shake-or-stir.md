Summary: When to shake or stir
Title: When to shake or stir

Shake when the drink has: citrus, heavy syrups, or a lot of ingredients.

Stir when it ... isn't those things.

When using aquafaba or egg white, you usually want to "dry shake": that is, shake without ice, so you get a good froth. Then carefully add a little ice and shake gently to chill.

(Aquafaba is the juice from a can of chick peas. It's the vegan replacement for egg white.)

NEVER add anything fizzy to a shaker. If you're not sure why, please watch Mr. Wizard until you understand basic physics and chemistry.
