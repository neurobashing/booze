Summary: Boston Cocktail

* 3/4 oz. dry gin
* 3/4 oz. apricot brandy (or your personal preference)
* Juice of 1/4 lemon
* 1/4 oz. Grenadine

Optionally, add some simple syrup if it's a little too dry for you. Shake well and strain into a cocktail glass, garnished with a lemon ribbon.

This is from The Old Mr. Boston De Luxe Official Bartender's Guide, 1966.
