Summary: Sunflower

* absinthe
* gin
* lemon juice
* St. Germain
* orange liqueur

Rinse glass with absinthe. (Pour in a tsp or so, and swirl around till it coats the inside of the glass. Chuck/drink the excess.)

Shake equal parts of the rest, and strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with lemon peel.

I haven't started giving stars on the site yet, but this one is a standout. Along with the various Daisy family, this is a standout summer drink. Don't like gin? You won't mind it. Think St. Germian - "the bartender's ketchup" - is too cloying and sweet, esp. when combined with Triple Sec? Not a problem. A masterclass in perfect balance.
