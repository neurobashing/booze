* 1 tablespoon of raspberry syrup
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1 wine-glass water
* 1 1/2 wine-glass brandy
* 1/2 small-sized lemon
* 2 slices orange
* 1 piece pine-apple

Fill the tumbler with shaved ice, shake well, and dress the top with orange, pine-apple, berries, &c, in season; sip through a straw.

This is the classic, 1860's era. A modern version would use 1 barspoon of syrup and 1 of powdered sugar, 1 oz. of water, 1 1/2 oz. brandy, and 1/2 oz. lemon juice.
