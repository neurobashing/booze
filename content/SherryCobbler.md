Summary: Sherry Cobbler


* 2 oz Sherry
* 1 oz Brandy 
* 1 oz Orange curaçao
* 1 tsp superfine sugar 
* Orange slices, for garnish 
* 1 oz Port

Fill a shaker two-thirds full with crushed ice. Add all ingredients but the Port, then shake vigorously. Transfer contents to a tall glass or wineglass. Garnish with two orange slices, over which you’ll gently pour the Port. Serve with two straws.

I originally made this with sweet Vermouth instead of Sherry, and it wasn't bad.
