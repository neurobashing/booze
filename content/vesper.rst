On the off change it's taken down, here's what Cmdr. Bond asks the barman for:

* One measure of vodka
* Three measures of Gordon's
* half a measure of Kina Lillet

Shake over ice, add a thin slice of lemon peel.

It is my understanding that Kina Lillet is currently unavailable; you can search for various alternatives.

Another one I have in my notes is:

* 2 oz. gin
* 1/2 oz. vodka
* 1/4 oz. Lillet Blonde

* Shaken, **not stirred**, served in a chilled cocktail glass and garnished with a lemon peel.
