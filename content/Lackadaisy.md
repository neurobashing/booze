Summary: Lackadaisy


* 3⁄4 oz Gin (Old Tom style works really well)
* 3⁄4 oz Benedictine
* 3⁄4 oz lemon juice
* 3⁄4 oz fizzy water (historically, lithia water - soda water containing lithium salts.)

Shake and strain, then top with fizzy water and garnish with a lemon wheel. 

This is kind of a simplified Sunflower. It's very good and arguably slightly easier to make (since it's 2 ingredients and some lemon).
