Title: Last Word

* 1 1/2 oz. gin
* 1 1/2 oz. maraschino
* 1 1/2 oz. lime juice
* 1 1/2 oz. green Chartreuse

Shake and strain in a coupe glass, garnish with lime peel.

This is probably my favorite gin drink. It's also more potent that it seems; Green Chartreuse is 110 proof, it's not a light liqueur.
