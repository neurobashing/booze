Summary: Brandy Cocktail
Title: Brandy Cocktail

* 3 or 4 dashes of gum syrup
* 2 dashes of bitters
* 1 wine-glass of brandy
* 1 or 2 dashes of Curacao

Moisten glass with lemon peel and rim with sugar. Use the lemon peel to line to inside rim of the glass. Stir and strain.

(This is the 1860s version. A modern version would use 1/2 oz. rich simple syrup, 1 dash bitters, 1 oz. brandy, and 1/2 oz. Curacao.)
