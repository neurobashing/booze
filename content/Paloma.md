Summary: Paloma

* blanco tequila
* grapefruit juice
* lime juice
* simple syrup
* club soda

Shake equal parts of everything, except the soda, and strain into a Collins glass. Top with soda.

**ALTERNATE VERSION FOR FLORIDIANS**

My mom invented this entirely independently. It's called a Frescarita.

* blanco tequila (a shot or two)
* Fresca (original flavor, although experimentation is encouraged)
* lime juice

Stir in whatever glassware is available. You can do, like, a shot or two and fill the rest of the glass with Fresca. If in Florida, drink until you make bad life decisions.
