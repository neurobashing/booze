Summary: Some Syrups

Everyone knows simple (1:1 sugar/water) and heavy (2:1 sugar/water). Here are some more:

**Golden Milk Punch**

* 2 cups coconut milk or almond milk
* 1⁄4 oz pure vanilla extract
* 3⁄4 oz maple syrup
* Freshly grated nutmeg
* Ground cinnamon
* 1⁄2 teaspoon ground turmeric

In a medium-size saucepan, combine the coconut milk, vanilla, maple, and a pinch each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and turmeric over medium-low heat. Stirring constantly, being careful not to burn the milk. Bring to an almost boil, and then remove from heat. (Note that it will boil below 212 degrees, somewhere around 185)

You can serve cold or warm, adding a shot of rye or bourbon. It's also really good in coffee!

**Salted Honey syrup**

Add 1 gram of salt per 150 grams of water and allow the salt to fully dissolve. Heat the salt solution in a small saucepan and add 150 grams of clover honey. Fully incorporate the honey and the salt solution until you have a uniform syrup. Allow to cool and store for up to a month.

Change up the honey as it pleases you. I might like this better than plain ol' simple, but honey has a flavor (compared to sugar, whose flavor is "sweet"), so I don't see it used in every case. But it's good.

**Cucumber syrup**

Boil equal parts water and sugar with half of a peeled and sliced cucumber. Remove from heat, strain while still warm, pressing against the cucumbers to extract more juice and color. Allow to cool then refrigerate for up to two weeks.

If you have a bullet blender that works great to pulverize the cukes. Be sure to retain as much water as you can.
