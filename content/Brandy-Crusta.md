Summary: Brandy Crusta

* 2 oz brandy (1757 Brandy)
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 1‚ÅÑ2 oz ginger syrup
* Ginger beer
* 1 slice candied ginger
* 1 lemon peel garnish
* sugar crust rim

Crust the rim of an old fashioned glass with sugar. Mix all ingredients (except the ginger beer) in a shaker. Strain carefully into the old fashioned glass, so as not to disturb the sugar rim. Top with ginger beer. Garnish with a lemon peel and ginger slice.

Extra points if you take a bit of lemon peel and line the interior of the glass (use a coupe or similar) and pour through that.
