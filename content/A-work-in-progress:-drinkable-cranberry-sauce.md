Summary: A work in progress: drinkable cranberry sauce

So I picked up some cranberry whiskey from [Still Hollow](https://stillhollowspirits.com). I wanted to make a drink that was basically "drinkable cranberry sauce".

The base: 1oz whiskey
The complement: 1/8 oz walnut liqueur

**record scratch** Walnuts? In cranberry sauce??? Yes, [it exists](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cranberry-sauce-with-walnuts/). My wife makes it from time to time. It's good; give it a try!

Anyway, I then added a couple dashes of orange bitters. Shake and strain.

It's ... a good start, but not there. 

Since corn whiskey is a more neutral spirit, it doesn't have the same body and "chew" as rye or bourbon. 

I want to keep the cranberry flavor forward, so I don't want to add citrus. Simple syrup? Well corn whiskey has more sweetness than vodka, but not enough. The downside is do I want *just* sweet? Maybe Demarara sugar, instead? And heavier than simple?

I added a touch of black walnut bitters, too, and I'm torn if I want to just use it instead of the liqueur.

Making what seems a simple drink is actually really difficult.
