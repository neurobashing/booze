Summary: Orange Blossom (Variant)


* 3 parts (rye) whisky
* Honey
* dash orange bitters

In the glass _without ice_, dissolve the honey by gently stirring into the whisky. How much? To taste; about 2 barspoons worth is what I do. Add a dash of orange bitters, give it a quick stir, and then add ice.
