* 1 oz. rye
* 3/4 oz. lime juice
* 1/2 - 3/4 oz. agave syrup
* 1/2 oz. dry Curacao (or Triple Sec and it's too late to go to the liquor store)

Salt the rim of a cocktail glass with chile salt, or I guess regular salt if that's what you have. Shake and strain. Garnish with a lime slice.

"Margarita" is the Spanish word for "daisy", and for what it's worth, I don't drink regular (Tequila) margaritas any more. Yes, my palate tends to rye, but I still think this is just better.
