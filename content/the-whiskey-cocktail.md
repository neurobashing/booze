Summary: The Whiskey Cocktail
Title: The Whiskey Cocktail

* 3 or 4 dashes of gum syrup
* 2 dashes of bitters
* 1 wine-glass of whiskey

Fill one-third full with fine ice; shake and strain in a fancy red wine-glass. Garnish with lemon peel.

This is an 1860's era cocktail. A modern version would use 1/2 oz. of rich simple syrup (2:1 sugar:water instead of 1:1), a dash of Angostura bitters, and an ounce of whiskey.
