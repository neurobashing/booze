Summary: Gin Fix
Title: Gin Fix

* (Use a small bar glass.)
* 1 table-spoonful of sugar
* 1/2 of a lemon
* 1/2 a wine-glass of water
* 1 wine-glass of gin

Fill two-thirds with shaved ice. Stir with a spoon, and ornament the top with fruits of the season.

This is a classic, 1860's cocktail; it's the predecessor of all gin sour cocktails - the Gin Sour, the Tom Collins, Gin Fizz, etc.

A modern version would use 1/2 oz. of powdered sugar, 1/4 - 1/2 oz lemon juice, 1/2 oz. of water, and 1 oz. gin. Shake and serve in a cocktail glass.
