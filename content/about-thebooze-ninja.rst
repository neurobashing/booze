OK remember to always drink responsibly.

Also, all things in moderation, including moderation.

I am not a bartender, affiliated with anything in the "alcohol industry", and there are no affiliate links. I am doing this for my own amusement, and to share with my pals. I'm not even a "blogger". Ugh. Who even is that any more.

I do however endorse `Catoctin Creek Distilling <https://catoctincreekdistilling.com/>`__. They're a great local company run by cool people and they are at least more than a little responsible for me caring about "mixology" as a craft, and getting into the history of booze. As opposed to just drinking. Also their rye whisky is the best I've had, their gin is about the only I'll drink, and their brandy is amazing.

Lastly: this site is just a transcription of my notes and stuff. I am in no way trying to be a reference for anyone but me, my wife, and my pals. If I have the proportions wrong or call a drink by a different name, please let me know; but in all honesty this is my personal reference. I'm not `Jerry Thomas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Thomas_(bartender)>`__ or `Harry Craddock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Craddock>`__.
