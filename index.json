It's gots lots of electrolytes. It's my go-to post-workout drink.You can google various recipes. Mine is roughly:1. Make a strong, strong, strong ginger syrup. Finely chop a big-ass hand, boil it with 1:1 sugar, and then simmer for an hour or two.2. Once it's cooked down to at least 25% reduction, strain and cool.Then to drink, mix approximately 2:1 with *good* apple cider vinegar; you want the kind with the \"mother\". Top with sugar-free fizzy water (whatever flavor happens to be around; lime is usually good).The fun is, mess with your sugars - try molasses, various honeys, and so on - and strengths of syrup and vinegar. There's no \"right\" answer.It's truly one of the best recovery/post-workout drinks ever. It's great when you need a pick-me-up, or want something that's sweet and sour but not a soda. It also fills in as a \" mocktail\" if you want something vaguely boozy but can't drink."},
